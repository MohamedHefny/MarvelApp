## Libraries
   * [LiveData][1] - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
   * [ViewModel][2] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations.
   * [Room][3] - Access your app's SQLite database with in-app objects and compile-time checks.
   * [Retrofit][4] -  Type-safe HTTP client networking library.
   * [Butterknife][5] - Binding the views. So, you don't need to call findViewByID() over and over.
   * [Picasso][6] - For images loading.
